# Python-Data-Parse

This repository is dedicated to practicing parsing of large datasets in an effective and efficient manner.

The primary program utilizes Pandas to handle CSV data with backup support from the XLRD module for Excel support. I intend to incorporate GUI creation via PyQT4 and statistical representations through Matplotlib. The end goal is a multifaceted interface for combing through sets of data with visuals describing terms of interest.
