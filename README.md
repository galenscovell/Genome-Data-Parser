# Python-Data-Parse

This repository is dedicated to the design and construction of a genomic data parser for the Tublitz Neuroscience lab at the University of Oregon. All of the actual genomic data is hidden and private, and depending on how things play out the final version of this parser may also be made private.

The program utilizes 
* <b>Pandas</b> for handling CSV data 
* <b>XLRD</b> module for Excel support
* <b>PyQT4</b> for GUI creation
* <b>Matplotlib</b> for statistical representations 

The end goal is a multifaceted interface for combing through very large sets of data with visuals describing terms of interest.
